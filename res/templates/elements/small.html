        To keep your bread fresh<sup>(1)</sup>, store it in a cool, dry place. If you plan to eat it within a few days, you can store it at room temperature. If you want to keep it for longer, you can freeze it. To freeze bread, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a freezer bag. When you are ready to eat it, let it thaw at room temperature or warm it in the oven. Enjoy your fresh bread!
