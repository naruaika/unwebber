        The basic ingredients of a bread are <span class="ingredient">flour</span>, <span class="ingredient">water</span>, and <span class="ingredient">yeast</span>.
        The <span class="ingredient">flour</span> is the main ingredient of the bread.
        It is the one that gives the bread its structure and texture.
        The <span class="ingredient">water</span> is the one that makes the dough sticky and elastic.
        The <span class="ingredient">yeast</span> is the one that makes the bread rise.
        It is a living organism that feeds on the sugar in the flour and produces carbon dioxide gas.
        This gas gets trapped in the dough and makes it rise.
        The rising of the dough is what gives the bread its light and airy texture.
