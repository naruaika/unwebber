    Water has a chemical formula of H<sub>2</sub>O.
    That's why it's also known as dihydrogen monoxide.
    On the other hand, flour has a chemical formula of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.
    It's complex carbohydrates, a long chain of glucose molecules.
    There's no immediate chemical reaction when you mix water with flour.
